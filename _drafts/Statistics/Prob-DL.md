**Probabilistic Deep Learning**
- Think of Neural Networks as probability models!
- 

**Posterior Predictive**
- Using a point estimate for params when making predictions is a *plug-in approximation*
- Prone to overfitting... Instead we consider a bayesian approach
- Use law of total probability to integrate out 'nuisance' parameters!
