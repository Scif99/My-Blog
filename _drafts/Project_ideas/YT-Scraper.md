**Idea**

I have lots of youtube subscriptions. Maybe too many. Often I go through phases where I subscribe to lots of youtubers ...

What if you could create a program that checks when videos from a specific subset of your subscription uploads, and sends them to you via email, or posts links to them on a website?

- This could be generalised to multiple subsets, so that videos from each subset are grouped. For example, you could create a set of coding channels, and a set of gaming channels. The program might then send two playlists each day, one for the coding ones and the other for gaming.
